# Platform for the MEx (Metadata Exchange) project

This repository contains a snapshot of the code for the MEx metadata platform.
It was built by Data4Life in connection with the [MEx (Metadata Exchange) project](https://www.data4life.care/en/projects/mex/) as part of a cooperation with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).
The MEx platform is built to allow effective storage, management, search, and display of metadata, especially metadata related to scientific data and research. 
It consists of a Stencil webapp and several backend services written in Go - see the links below for information on how to run a demo on your local machine. 

The MEx platform is based on the [D4L FAIR metadata platform](https://www.data4life.care/de/d4l-fair/).
If you are interested in learning more about D4L FAIR, you can contact us via [d4l-fair@data4life.care](mailto:d4l-fair@data4life.care).
